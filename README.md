# Credit-EDA
This is internship project in 1stop ai as data science 
Credit EDA Project
This repository contains code for an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on credit data. The project aims to analyze a dataset containing information about individuals' credit applications and build predictive models to determine the likelihood of defaulting on credit payments.

Key Features:
Data Cleaning: The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and encode categorical variables using Label Encoding.
Model Building: Three machine learning models are trained on the preprocessed data: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
Model Evaluation: The accuracy of each model is evaluated using the test data, and the results are compared using a bar plot.
Visualization: The project includes visualizations to help understand the data distribution and model performance.
Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is stored in the application_data.csv file. It includes various features such as age, income, loan amount, and other relevant information about credit applicants.

How to Use:
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn).
Run the credit_eda_project.py script to execute the EDA and train the predictive models.
Explore the results and visualizations generated by the script.
